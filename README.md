# Sorting Algorithm Comparison

Homework for Algorithm Course.

**Requirement**

Compare the execution time among the following five algorithms:

* Bubble sort

* Insertion sort

* Selection sort

* Quick sort

* Heap sort

by applying each algorithm on number sets of sizes: 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 250,000 and 300,000.

**My work**

* Using C prog. lang.

* Using integers generated by `random()` function with time seeds.

* Including `.c` & `.h` code files inthis repo.

* Including a visualization ipynb based on c program output

* Also including a report(Chinese) in this repo.

**Estimated future enhancements**

* Inappropriate utilization of header files needs regularization.

* Split execution of the 5 algorithms that needs integration.

* More sorting algorithms could be included.

**Results**

**Additional info.**

* Bubble sort

   * Average case: O(n^2)

   * Best case: O(n)

   * Worst case: O(n^2)

* Insertion sort

   * Average case: O(n^2)

   * Best case: O(n)

   * Worst case: O(n^2)

* Selection sort

   * Average case: O(n^2)

   * Best case: O(n^2)

   * Worst case: O(n^2)

* Quick sort

   * Average case: O(nlog(n))

   * Best case: O(nlog(n))

   * Worst case: O(n^2)

* Heap sort

   * Average case: O(nlog(n))

   * Best case: O(nlog(n))

   * Worst case: O(nlog(n))
